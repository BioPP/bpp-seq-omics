 * The user specifies the focus species. Sequences that are not in this set will
 * be automatically merged and their coordinates removed.
 * The scores, if any, will be averaged for the block, weighted by the corresponding block sizes.
 * The pass value will be removed if it is different for the two blocks.
 * It is possible to define a maximum distance for the merging. Setting a distance of zero implies that the blocks
 * have to be exactly contiguous. Alternatively, the appropriate number of 'N' will be inserted in all species.
 * All species however have to be distant of the exact same amount.
