 * @brief Filter maf blocks to remove ambiguously aligned or non-informative regions.
 *
 * Regions with a too high proportion of gaps, unknown character or high entropy in a set of species will be removed,
 * and blocks adjusted accordingly. 
 *
 * The total entropy of a window is defined as @f$ \frac{\sum_i {E(5)}_i}{w} @f$ where @f$E(5)_i@f$ is the shannon entropy of site i, computed using a logarithm of base 5, and w is the window size.
 * As a result, the total entropy is normalized so that it falls between 0 and 1. A logarithm of base 5 is used to account for the fact that gaps are considered as a state.
 *
 * In case a sequence from the list is missing, it can be either ignored or counted as a full sequence of gaps.
