 * @brief Compute a series of sequence statistics for each block.
 *
 * Computed statistics are stored into a vector of double, which can be retrieved as well as statistics names.
 * Listeners can be set up to automatically analyse or write the output after iterations are over.
 *
 * The current implementation focuses on speed and memory efificiency, as it only stores in memory the current results of the statistics.
 * The only drawback of this, is that disk access might be high when writing the results,
 * although appropriate buffering should most likely circumvent the issue.
 * The code is easily extensible, however, to enable storage of all results into a matrix,
 * with writing only once at the end of iterations.
